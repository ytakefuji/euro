For fitting func(a*x*x*x+b*x*x+c*x+d):
a=0.002003539248547459 b=-0.9077447589323873 c=134.36788967707497 d=-6129.516347813743

Based on the fitting func, euro.py can predict the number of deaths on Nov. 23 (30 days) and on dec.23 (60 days) from Oct. 22 in 2020.

If we keep the same policy and attitudes in Europe, 
3410 deaths on Nov. 23 and 6579 deaths on Dec. 23 are expected.
